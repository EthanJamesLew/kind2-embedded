(** Normalize a Lustre AST to ease in translation to a transition system

  The two main requirements of this normalization are to:
    1. Guard any unguarded pre expressions 
    2. Generate any needed local identifiers or oracles

  Identifiers are constructed with a numeral prefix followed by a type suffix.
  e.g. 2_glocal or 6_oracle. These are not valid lustre identifiers and are
  expected to be transformed into indexes with the numeral as a branch and the
  suffix type as the leaf.

  Generated locals/oracles are referenced inside the AST via an Ident expression
  but the actual definition is not added to the AST. Instead it is recoreded in
  the generated_identifiers record.

  pre operators are explicitly guarded in the AST by an oracle variable
  if they were originally unguarded
    e.g. pre expr => oracle -> pre expr

  The following parts of the AST are abstracted by locals:

  1. Arguments to node calls that are not identifiers
    e.g.
      Node expr1 expr2 ... exprn
      =>
      Node l1 l2 ... ln
    where each li is a local variable and li = expri

  2. Arguments to the pre operator that are not identifiers
    e.g.
      pre expr => pre l
    where l = expr

  3. Guards of the arrow operator that are not constant or identifiers
    e.g.
      expr1 -> expr2 => l1 -> expr2
    where l1 = expr1
